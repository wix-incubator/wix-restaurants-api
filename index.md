# Wix Restaurants API

## *** Deprecated API - Will be removed by August 1st 2022 ***

The Wix Restaurants API is the canonical way to integrate with the [Wix Restaurants](http://www.wix.com/restaurant/website) platform.

The API exposes the full functionality of the platform (there are no private APIs), and all Wix Restaurants products are developed on top of it.

For best results, use the official SDKs for [Java](https://github.com/wix/wix-restaurants-java-sdk) or [JavaScript](https://github.com/wix/wix-restaurants-js-sdk). Alternatively, read on.
